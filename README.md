├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── add.py            # Calculator functions
```

## Installation

No special installation is required. This project uses standard Python and doesn't require any external dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Usage

### Importing the Calculator Functions

To use the calculator functions in your Python code:

```python
from add import addition

# Use the addition function
result = addition(10, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

### Running from Command Line

You can test the calculator functions directly:

```bash
python3 -c "from add import addition; print('Result:', addition(10, 3))"
```

## Available Functions

### `addition(a, b)`

Performs a mathematical operation between two numbers.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (int/float): First number
- `b` (int/float): Second number

**Returns:**
- The result of the mathematical operation

**Example:**
```python
result = addition(8, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

## Contributing
